```

Each stage must be independently testable.

---

## 2. Runtime environment

Primary target:
- Windows desktop
- current Windows desktop WeChat 4.x family
- user uses a laptop display plus an external monitor
- WeChat is commonly placed on the right side of the laptop display
- dark theme is the initial real-world visual target

Do **not** encode "right side of laptop screen" as product logic.

### WSL development constraint

Codex commonly runs inside WSL.

Native WeChat observation and overlay execution must run in the Windows desktop session. Source editing can happen from WSL, but Windows-specific runtime tests must use Windows execution (for example Windows `dotnet`/PowerShell via interop).

---

## 3. Recommended project structure

A suggested .NET solution layout:

```text
src/
  WeChatJevHud.App/              # WPF host, composition root
  WeChatJevHud.Core/             # domain models and orchestration
  WeChatJevHud.Windows/          # Win32, monitor, DPI, window tracking
  WeChatJevHud.Capture/          # window/client frame capture
  WeChatJevHud.Vision/           # ROI, frame diff, bubble detection
  WeChatJevHud.Ocr/              # OCR abstraction + implementation(s)
  WeChatJevHud.Observer/         # change detection, reconciliation, recent state
  WeChatJevHud.TypeSafe/         # Jev client and typed judgment mapping
  WeChatJevHud.Overlay/          # overlay layout/anchoring
tests/
  WeChatJevHud.Core.Tests/
  WeChatJevHud.Windows.Tests/
  WeChatJevHud.Vision.Tests/
  WeChatJevHud.TypeSafe.Tests/
fixtures/
  screenshots/
```

This is a default, not a requirement if an equally modular structure already exists.

---

## 4. Core domain models

Use records/immutable types where practical.

### Rectangle

Maintain an explicit distinction between:
- capture pixels relative to WeChat surface;
- physical desktop pixels;
- WPF DIPs.

Do not pass anonymous `(x,y,w,h)` tuples across layers without declaring the coordinate space.

Example:

```csharp
public readonly record struct PixelRect(int X, int Y, int Width, int Height);
```

### Message

Conceptual shape:

```csharp
public sealed record ChatMessage(
    string Id,
    MessageSide Side,
    string Text,
    PixelRect BubbleRect,
    string? QuotedText,
    PixelRect? QuotedRegion,
    DateTimeOffset ObservedAt,
    double? OcrConfidence,
    bool IsVisible
);

public enum MessageSide
{
    Remote,
    Self,
    System,
    Unknown
}
```

Fields may evolve, but preserve the separation between:
- observed facts;
- inferred semantic judgments.

For a quoted reply, `QuotedRegion`/`QuotedText` are optional metadata associated
with the containing message. They are not independent message bubbles. Phase 2
does not detect that secondary region; Phase 3 may add it without changing the
meaning of `DetectedBubble.Bounds` as the main message-bubble bounds.

### Message identity

A message must not be re-submitted to Jev on every frame.

V0 can build a stable-enough visible-message identity from a combination of:
- side
- normalized OCR text
- quoted text if present
- temporal appearance/order
- approximate geometry only as a weak signal

Do not use raw `y` coordinate alone because messages move when the chat scrolls.

---

## 5. WeChat window tracking

### Responsibilities

`IWeChatWindowTracker` should provide:
- top-level WeChat HWND
- process identity
- visible/minimized state
- foreground relationship
- top-level/client/render bounds
- current monitor
- DPI scale
- location/size change notification

### Discovery hints

Observed in the user's environment:
- UIA exposes a `Weixin` outer element
- render shell includes `MMUIRenderSubWindowHW`

Community code for current WeChat often observes:
- process `Weixin.exe`
- Qt top-level window classes such as `Qt51514QWindowIcon`
- render child prefix `MMUIRenderSubWindow`

Treat exact class names as hints, not permanent API contracts.

Prefer:
1. process identity
2. top-level visible window
3. class/title heuristics
4. render child prefix as an optional aid

### Events

Prefer WinEvent hooks for lifecycle/location where reliable:
- foreground changes
- minimize start/end
- location changes

A low-frequency polling fallback is acceptable.

### Multi-monitor

Requirements:
- support virtual desktop coordinates including negative X/Y;
- use Per-Monitor DPI Awareness V2;
- explicitly convert physical pixels <-> WPF DIPs;
- recalculate after monitor or DPI change.

---

## 6. Frame capture

Define:

```csharp
public interface IWindowCapture
{
    CapturedFrame Capture(WeChatWindowSnapshot window);
}
```

Preferred production direction: Windows Graphics Capture or another Windows-native capture path that works with the user's visible WeChat render surface.

For Spike 1, a simpler visible-screen-region capture is acceptable if it gets to bubble detection faster.

### Important constraints

- Do not capture the whole virtual desktop if the WeChat render/chat region is known.
- The eventual HUD must not recursively pollute the captured frame. Use an exclude-from-capture mechanism where supported, or capture the underlying WeChat surface directly.
- Detect and handle minimized/invalid windows.

---

## 7. Chat region

The initial screenshot has:
- left navigation rail;
- conversation list;
- large right chat pane;
- header at top;
- input/composer region at bottom.

V0 may use calibrated/relative heuristics for the user's current layout.

Production rule:
- no absolute global pixel constants;
- derive ROI from current WeChat window/render bounds;
- store calibration as relative or structural measurements.

A temporary debug UI for adjusting the chat ROI is acceptable and may be useful.

Phase 2 uses a replaceable chat-region seam:

```csharp
public interface IChatRegionLocator
{
    DetectedChatRegion Locate(CapturedFrame frame);
}
```

The initial dark-theme adapter locates the conversation-list/chat divider, header
bottom, and composer top from long structural edges. Compact layouts without a
conversation list use the header geometry as a relative fallback. The returned
rectangle is always capture-relative; display resolution and desktop position are
not inputs.

---

## 8. Bubble detection

Define:

```csharp
public interface IBubbleDetector
{
    IReadOnlyList<DetectedBubble> Detect(CapturedFrame frame, PixelRect chatRegion);
}
```

Conceptual output:

```csharp
public sealed record DetectedBubble(
    PixelRect Bounds,
    MessageSide Side,
    double DetectionScore
);
```

`DetectionScore` is an uncalibrated heuristic quality/ranking score. It must not
be presented as a probability. Keep it distinct from a later OCR engine's
`OcrConfidence` and Jev's `Probability`/confidence values.

Initial visual scope:
- dark WeChat theme;
- self messages: green bubbles, right aligned;
- remote messages: dark gray bubbles, left aligned;
- centered gray text is typically time/system content;
- quoted replies have nested/secondary text regions.

Do not require a deep-learning detector for the first spike. Classical CV/connected components/edges/color/layout heuristics are acceptable if they meet the acceptance criteria.

The initial dark-theme detector uses connected bubble-color regions, rectangular
fill/shape, text-contrast evidence, and left/right anchoring. This deliberately
ignores unbacked timestamp text and obvious image/sticker regions. It may return
`Unknown` when a bubble-like text region is not convincingly anchored to either
side. Detection remains behind `IBubbleDetector`; no OCR participates in Phase 2.

### Debug mode

Must be able to render/export a debug frame containing:
- chat ROI
- one rectangle per detected bubble
- `remote/self/unknown`
- heuristic detection score
- capture-relative coordinates

This is required before OCR integration.

---

## 9. Change detection and new-message observation

The steady-state system should not OCR the whole chat at high frequency.

Target behavior:

```text
lightweight frame/ROI comparison
  -> no meaningful change: do nothing
  -> change detected:
       detect/reconcile visible bubbles
       OCR only new/changed candidate crops
       normalize/dedupe
       process newly observed remote message
```

The exact interval should be measured rather than assumed. A starting range around 5–10 lightweight checks per second is acceptable for experimentation, provided CPU usage is measured.

Scrolling must be treated differently from a genuinely new message where possible.

Phase 4 exposes one stateful `IMessageObserver` seam. Capture supplies a valid frame;
the observer owns chat-ROI fingerprinting, visual conversation epochs, bubble
reconciliation, OCR scheduling, bounded recent state, counters, timings, and message
events. Capture, ROI/bubble detection, OCR, and conversation identity remain injected
adapters rather than state hidden in the capture loop.

The first frame in an epoch is a bootstrap: visible bubbles may be OCRed to seed
context, but they never produce `NewMessageObserved`. The top-level HWND title is not
used. A replaceable visual-identity provider searches the stable left/central header,
finds the dominant bright title-ink band, and canonicalizes tight ink bounds to a
128×24 area-occupancy grid. Local glyph-scale/overall ink differences and aspect ratio
distinguish similar titles without being dominated by background. Separate title-bar
ink and dynamic right-side controls are excluded. No-ink views retain the coarse
perceptual/luminance fallback. Default thresholds are explicit in
`VisualConversationIdentityOptions`; evidence remains opaque outside the replaceable
identity-provider seam.

A changed header is `PossibleConversationChange`, never an immediate epoch switch.
The observer first reconciles the candidate view specifically against the immediately
previous visible-message snapshot. Strong continuity consists of ordered matches using
trusted normalized OCR text plus side, or at least two matches under a separate strict
visual threshold; a live tail is strong only when trusted text matches or strict visual
identity participates in that multi-message ordered continuity. The normal permissive
perceptual threshold, dimensions/geometry, and
matches found only in the bounded recent-history buffer are weak evidence. They may
assist message reconciliation but cannot rebase a changed conversation identity.
A title mismatch on a stable layout additionally requires at least three diverse
strict matches covering 80% of the previous/current view to approve a visual rebase.
Old-identity cached OCR is not hydrated unless visual rebase evidence permits it;
otherwise independently acquired pending-candidate OCR seeds the confirmed new epoch.
Without strong previous-visible continuity, the same candidate must remain stable for
three observations before a switch is confirmed. The first two observations remain
pending and do not mutate the current conversation state or emit messages; pending OCR
is reused only within that candidate identity. A confirmed switch clears the old state
exactly once and enters `AwaitingInitialSnapshot`. An empty viewport on the confirming
frame is not an established empty baseline because WeChat may still be rendering the
target conversation. A non-empty visible snapshot must remain strongly visually
equivalent for two consecutive observations by default before it establishes the
baseline; messages discovered throughout this settling interval remain Bootstrap. If
the viewport instead remains empty for three stable observations by default, the
observer establishes a genuine empty baseline; a message arriving afterward may then
be LiveNew. Both gates are configurable through `ObserverOptions`. Identical frames
continue through detection only during this short settling gate. Finalization rebases
the live-tail anchor to the stable non-empty snapshot, while empty finalization
discards any provisional non-empty settling state.

Frame dimensions or chat-ROI changes start a layout transition. A transition requires
two stable-layout observations before weak/no-overlap evidence may advance a switch.
Unstable transition frames cannot switch epochs and avoid OCR when visual continuity
is not yet available. Empty views rebase after layout stabilization. This policy is
intentionally conservative across 150%/100% DPI rerendering.

Visible bubble identity locks the immediately previous visible ordered occurrences
first, then fills chronological gaps from recent history. Maximum-cardinality
alignment ties minimize geometry displacement, using a global Y translation/scale
estimated from mutually unique strict visible anchors. Side/fingerprint/text remains
the match predicate; Y alone is not identity. This
allows repeated identical messages to receive distinct logical IDs during history
reconciliation, but does not authorize NEW.

Before history reconciliation, `LiveEdgeAppendDetector` compares previous-visible and
current complete crop fingerprints, side, shape and ordered geometry. Stable identity/
layout, an established baseline and the known live tail are required. A stationary
prefix plus a bottom suffix is an append even if every occurrence is equal. Consistent
upward translation requires a unique ordered anchor; dropped prefixes must project
outside the viewport or correspond to a top-clipped historical prefix (whose text
remains protected by existing partial rules). Accepted occurrence bindings and the new suffix are reserved
before history alignment/OCR reuse. Generic history matches cannot label a suffix NEW.
An established empty baseline can accept its first complete message. Return to a known
tail restores eligibility for the next frame only. This live-edge state is inferred
from observed continuity, not a scrollbar or desktop coordinate. Current visible crop
fingerprints are separate from the complete OCR-cache fingerprint so rerendering does
not disarm future appends. Ambiguous all-equal moving views and partial suffixes are
conservative history; pixel-identical sampled scroll/append
ambiguities remain unobservable. `live_edge_append` diagnostics give the decision,
previous retained start, new suffix start and translation without printing chat text.

On the non-append path, history reconciliation first attempts an ordered window/
subsequence of the known chronological timeline (D-029). Exact complete-crop identity
is preferred; existing strong visual evidence plus shape, or independent trusted text
plus side, can also anchor it. Full known views reuse ordered occurrences without
allocating History IDs, even when repeated messages have ambiguous Y positions.
For partial discoveries, unique anchors bound gaps where genuinely unseen older
messages may be inserted. Previous-visible geometry is fallback evidence, not an
override of a resolved known window. This step never consumes an accepted append
suffix and never changes NEW eligibility. Recovery is limited to the bounded retained
timeline within the same epoch; it is not persistent arbitrary-history tracking.

Bubble completeness uses frame-local nominal height, top/bottom distance and rounded
background-cap evidence (D-026), not mere containment in the usable chat ROI.
Near-boundary ambiguity is partial; closed full single/multiline shapes may still be
complete near the bottom. Diagnostics expose distances, height ratio, boundary risk
and completeness reason. `IsFullyVisible` describes the current view and
`HasCompleteText` describes stored text evidence. Unmatched History candidates without
`HasCompleteTextEvidence` remain frame-local fragments: no logical ID allocation,
timeline insertion, persistent message, or visible logical snapshot. Their bounds and
completeness remain in frame diagnostics. Known matched partials reuse existing IDs,
skip fresh OCR and cannot become semantic-ready. Surviving-edge reconciliation
requires a unique neighboring translation anchor; later full crops can complete the
same logical record, emitting an observation update but never replaying history as NEW.
Full text already stored is preserved during clipping. Full reappearance may reuse
it only with the stored complete-crop fingerprint or independent complete OCR equality.
Uncertain association falls back to conservative discovery rather than borrowing text.

The observer reports:

```text
frames_checked
unchanged_frames
changed_frames
bubble_detection_runs
ocr_calls
messages_emitted
duplicates_suppressed
conversation_switches
identity_mismatch_candidates
identity_rebases
identity_switches_confirmed
identity_switches_suppressed
layout_transitions
```

Each changed-identity diagnostic also separates
`previous_visible_strong_overlap`, `previous_visible_weak_overlap`,
`trusted_text_overlap`, `live_tail_strong_match`, `live_tail_weak_match`, and
`history_only_matches`. The weak counts exclude matches already classified as strong,
and reused OCR text is not counted as independent trusted-text evidence. No aggregate
visual-overlap count is used as switch approval.

Identity diagnostics also expose structured `TitleVisualDistance` and
`TitleAspectDistance`. Repeated-match diagnostics include previous ID/Y, candidate Y,
estimated delta Y, match cost and ambiguous occurrence count. Visibility diagnostics
report bubble bounds, chat ROI and completeness. No private title text is printed.

and per-frame `frame_check_ms`, `change_detect_ms`, `bubble_detect_ms`, `ocr_ms`, and
`observer_reconcile_ms`. Identical chat-ROI fingerprints skip bubble detection and OCR.

---

## 10. OCR

Define a replaceable interface:

```csharp
public interface IOcrEngine
{
    string Name { get; }
    Task<OcrResult> RecognizeAsync(ImageCrop crop, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

V0 language needs:
- Simplified Chinese
- English
- mixed Chinese/English
- punctuation

Emoji-only/sticker/image messages may be skipped in V0 rather than misrepresented as text.

### OCR selection

Do not lock the architecture to one OCR engine before testing real crops.

Possible implementations can include a Windows-native OCR path or a local model/service such as PaddleOCR, but the choice must be based on accuracy/latency against fixture crops.

The first OCR milestone should compare at least representative:
- short remote text
- long wrapped text
- self text
- quoted reply
- mixed Chinese/English

Return OCR confidence when available.

Phase 3 represents this explicitly as:

```csharp
public sealed record OcrResult(
    string Text,
    double? OcrConfidence,
    OcrTextStatus Status,
    string RawText);
```

`Text` is the engine's normalized text for consumers. `RawText` is required and
preserves the engine output used by evaluation; an adapter must not substitute
normalized text for unavailable raw output.

`OcrConfidence` is nullable because not every engine supplies it. It is neither a
`DetectionScore` nor a Jev probability. Engines with a confidence signal must return
`LowConfidence` below their documented threshold instead of silently promoting the
text to a trusted result. `NoText` and `Unsupported` are explicit non-text outcomes.

The Phase 3 evaluator receives a captured frame plus a capture-relative bubble or
optional quoted-region rectangle and extracts that crop before calling `IOcrEngine`.
It never submits the full WeChat window. A quoted region, when supplied, is associated
with its containing message and evaluated separately from the main message text.
Automatic quoted-region location remains outside Phase 3; callers must not silently
merge quote text and main text into one sentence.

Evaluation records raw and normalized recognized text, literal raw exact match,
normalized match, raw CER, and normalized CER separately. Generic `exact_match`
means literal equality with `RawText`; normalization cannot promote a raw mismatch to
an exact match. Normalization is conservative and CJK-aware, preserving normal Latin
punctuation spacing such as `123, I just got home.`.

### Phase 4.5 production OCR runtime

Unified Paddle is the normal production extraction path (D-023). Phase 2 still detects
message bubbles. Inside each isolated crop, `PP-OCRv6_small_det` determines line structure:
zero or one detection sends the **original whole crop** to `PP-OCRv6_small_rec`;
two or more detections use clipped axis-aligned boxes, ordered by vertical center then X.
There is no detector-box padding or image preprocessing. CJK wraps join without an
added space; Latin wraps join with one unless boundary whitespace already exists.
Raw per-line text remains available. Zero detections is a successful Paddle path.

The Paddle adapter remains behind `IOcrEngine` and communicates with one persistent,
configurable Windows-native Python worker. The worker loads and warms both models once,
then exchanges UTF-8 JSON Lines over redirected standard input/output. Every request
has an opaque ID and transfers PNG bytes in memory. Only protocol JSON may use stdout;
worker/library logs use stderr. Protocol v2 `READY` includes `detector_model` and
`recognizer_model`, PaddleOCR/PaddlePaddle
versions, requested/active device, startup time, and warmup time.

OCR results may carry `OcrDiagnostics` with route, trust basis, total time, and
engine-specific evidence. For Paddle, `EngineScoreKind` is `paddle_rec_score`, while
`OcrConfidence` is null. `rec_score` is not a correctness probability and cannot
establish trust.

Successful Paddle never invokes Adaptive. Under the accepted V0 D-028 policy,
non-empty output may become `Recognized` only with explicit complete-text,
semantic-region-separation and outside-edge-zone input evidence, normally completed
Unified extraction and valid line structure. Missing evidence remains `LowConfidence`;
empty output remains `NoText`. SemanticReady is permission under accepted residual
risk, not evidence that TranscriptExact is true. No model score or verifier participates.
Only runtime/model/protocol failure invokes Adaptive, whose output is explicitly untrusted.
No score threshold or further trust calibration is introduced. Diagnostics retain
line count, clipped boxes, per-line raw text/rec_score, composed raw output, detection,
recognition, worker-total and roundtrip times. Multiline has no fabricated aggregate score.
Independent `QuotedText` crops are processed separately. Main-message crops carry
`QuoteSeparationUnverified=true` unless the approved conservative single-region check
supplies evidence. Independent quoted crops are not merged into main text. Automatic
quote splitting is unavailable; ambiguous background/panel evidence stays untrusted.

The completed prerequisite input audit used matched 96-DPI and 144-DPI real bubble
crops. Experimental audit tooling derives the text
ROI conservatively from contrast against the bubble background, retain configurable
safe padding, estimate the text-band height, and compare 32/40/48 px normalization with
nearest, bicubic, Lanczos, and conservative grayscale/background variants. Use one
recognizer instance for the complete comparison. Audit artifacts and reports stay
under `.ocr-cache`; no audit variant becomes production behavior without separate
evidence and review. Variant agreement is correlated preprocessing evidence, not
independent-engine agreement.

The completed input audit demonstrated no benefit over raw bubble crops. Production
Paddle therefore continues to receive raw whole-bubble PNGs for zero/one-line crops.
The following routing analysis is retained **only as historical experimental tooling**.
Routing-only contrast
analysis excludes components connected to the crop boundary (bubble corners/tail
background). Estimated glyph height is the upper-quartile retained component height;
maximum bridged gap is 12% of that height and minimum band height is 15%, each at least
one pixel. These are explicit heuristics, not confidence. Crops with one retained
band formerly routed to Paddle; other layouts and quoted regions formerly used Adaptive.
Explicit routing diagnostics expose row counts, active states, background estimate,
glyph scale, thresholds, band count and selected route without calling OCR.

The preceding isolated Phase 4.5 experiment used `PP-OCRv6_small_det` inside these already
isolated bubble or quote crops, followed by `PP-OCRv6_small_rec` on axis-aligned line
boxes. This explicitly supersedes the earlier blanket prohibition on Paddle detection
initially for the experiment; D-023 now authorizes production use inside crops only. Phase 2 message detection is unchanged. Both models remain
resident across fixtures; document orientation, unwarping and text-line orientation
are disabled by using only the detection and recognition modules. Report line boxes,
raw line strings, composed text, literal/normalized evaluation and stage timings.
No production router removal or trust-policy change follows automatically from this
benchmark. See D-021 and the Phase 4.5 acceptance evidence.

The Unified benchmark follow-up uses original raw whole-bubble recognition when
small detection yields zero or one line, and retains the same line-box extraction
when it yields two or more. D-022's candidate is now implemented under D-023.
The old custom router and normal Adaptive fusion are removed from observer wiring;
trust calibration remains deferred.

Phase 4.5B experiments (D-027) are now frozen by D-028; no further verifier or
same-model probes enter production. Historical evaluation required separately recorded
manual full-crop/region provenance and excludes known partials, rather than relying on
the currently defective completeness classifier. Proposed trust decisions cannot
override visibility, completeness, empty/error/fallback or quote-separation gates.
Raw exactness, normalized equality, semantic equivalence and dangerous/polarity errors
remain separate; unknown semantic labels are not counted as confirmed safe outcomes.
Same-model and cross-representation stability are correlated evidence, not confidence.
The tested stability proposals still trust substantive errors and are not accepted.

V0 applies a separate 6 DIP semantic edge guard, converted using the capture monitor's
actual vertical DPI. A bubble with top or bottom usable-ROI distance below the rounded
guard is treated as incomplete semantic evidence regardless of rounded-cap diagnostics. It
may reconcile visually but cannot gain semantic readiness or replace complete text;
unknown partial text is not OCRed. Full crops outside the guard still require the
other hard gates. Native capture propagates DPI explicitly; offline fixtures default
to 96 unless supplied. No desktop resolution or message-side rule is involved.

`IsFullyVisible` is structural only, sourced from `BubbleCompletenessAnalyzer`.
It alone supplies visibility to append detection and live-edge/geometry state.
`HasCompleteTextEvidence = IsFullyVisible && OutsideSemanticEdgeGuard` controls
new crop OCR and establishing/replacing complete text. Stored `HasCompleteText`
may remain true for preserved older complete text while the current edge gate is
false; current semantic readiness must still be false. A successful structural
append retains LiveNew independently of OCR/trust eligibility.

Opt-in `WECHAT_APPEND_TRACE=1` on the diagnostics process emits structured
`append_attempt_trace` JSON before reconciliation: input live-edge/stable flags,
viewport, boundary margin, ordered bubble geometry, structural visibility, 64-bit
crop fingerprints and available previous logical IDs; each attempted start records
its first rejected predicate and Same-field differences. It includes no OCR text.
Array position is the bubble index. Keep redirected traces private under `.ocr-cache`.
Diagnostics do not relax predicates or change decisions and are disabled by default.
The same opt-in additionally emits `history_window_state` after changed-frame
reconciliation: epoch, ordered timeline IDs and current visible snapshots, with no
OCR text, so scroll return identity can be verified without exposing private text.
Opt-in state diagnostics also include protected persistent fields, with raw/normalized
text represented only by SHA-256 digests. These private artifacts permit before/after
content audits and must remain gitignored; digests are not anonymized public data.

`SemanticRegionInspector` provides the approved conservative V0 region evidence:
consistent inset background, sufficient background area, and no large solid embedded
panel. Tiny/ambiguous interiors fail closed. It neither detects messages nor changes
the crop sent to Paddle. Evidence is refreshed for currently visible candidates,
including reused OCR; unknown/embedded regions stay untrusted. This is not a complete
quote-layout parser: visually indistinguishable same-background quotes remain residual
risk. An independently supplied semantic crop still needs explicit input evidence.

---

## 11. Conversation state

Maintain a short in-memory window of recent normalized messages.

Conceptual state sent to Jev:

```json
{
  "current_message": {
    "side": "remote",
    "text": "都是磨合期了吗",
    "quoted_text": null
  },
  "recent_messages": [
    {"side": "self", "text": "在坡她就说什么在磨合期了 现在应该都磨平了"},
    {"side": "remote", "text": "诶哟我去"}
  ],
  "locale": "zh-CN"
}
```

Rules:
- send the minimum context needed;
- do not automatically upload the entire chat history;
- keep state ephemeral by default;
- distinguish observed text from Jev inference;
- invalidate/re-evaluate when underlying message text/context changes.

Phase 4 keeps this state in a configurable in-memory buffer (25 messages by default).
Each observed message retains logical ID, epoch, side, normalized and raw OCR text,
OCR status/confidence, capture-relative bubble rectangle, first-observed time,
bootstrap/history/live origin, visibility, and optional quote metadata. Nothing in
this buffer is persisted by the observer.

`IsTrustedForSemantics` is true only for non-empty `Recognized` OCR output with complete
stored text and a fully visible current candidate.
`LowConfidence`, `NoText`, and `Unsupported` messages may remain in observer state but
must not be treated as semantic-ready by later phases.

---

## 12. TypeSafe / Jev integration

### Skill and docs

Before coding, install:

```bash
npx skills add typesafe-ai/skills --skill typesafe-ai
```

Then read the live TypeSafe docs. The handoff intentionally does not freeze an API request schema because the official skill says current live docs are authoritative.

### Programming model

Use Jev as small semantic programming primitives:
- **Noul** for yes/no probability
- **Choice** for one outcome from a bounded set
- **Score** for ordered degree/intensity

Ask independent questions over the same state together when appropriate.

### Initial judgment set

Start small and observable.

#### Noul candidates

1. `expects_response`
   - Does the current remote message conventionally call for a response in this conversation?

2. `references_prior_context`
   - Does understanding the current message materially depend on prior conversation context?

3. `contains_direct_request`
   - Does the current message contain a direct request for the user to do/provide something?

4. `expresses_disagreement_or_correction`
   - Does the current message explicitly disagree with, correct, or challenge something in the recent context?

5. `contains_time_or_plan_commitment`
   - Does the current message propose, confirm, change, or constrain a time/plan/commitment?

#### Choice candidate: `speech_act`

Bounded options:
- question
- request
- answer
- acknowledgement
- clarification
- complaint_or_concern
- planning
- joke_or_banter
- information
- other

Include `other`; do not force a bad label.

#### Score candidates

Keep levels concrete.

`urgency`:
- 0: no timing pressure
- 1: mild preference for near-term response
- 2: clear promptness matters
- 3: immediate/near-immediate action or response is explicitly important

`emotional_intensity`:
- 0: neutral/low-affect
- 1: mild affect
- 2: clear strong affect
- 3: highly emphatic affect

Do not use emotional intensity as a mental-health diagnosis.

### UI use of probabilities

- Preserve probabilities/confidence in the UI.
- Do not convert uncertain judgments into categorical claims.
- Thresholds are product policy and must be validated on representative data.
- Typed output is not a truth guarantee.

### API key

Development:
- environment variable such as `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, or the official SDK's current recommended secret mechanism.

Never:
- commit the key;
- print it;
- include it in screenshots;
- include it in exception telemetry.

---

## 13. Judgment composition

The code, not Jev, decides what to display.

Example policy:
- only show a Noul row when probability is far enough from indecision to be useful;
- always allow debug mode to show raw outputs;
- show at most a few high-signal rows in collapsed HUD;
- expanded HUD may show all configured judgments.

Avoid turning several weak signals into a strong psychological claim.

## 14. Overlay/HUD

### Window behavior

The overlay is a separate transparent companion window.

Requirements:
- topmost only as needed relative to WeChat;
- click-through when collapsed unless the user is interacting with it;
- hide when WeChat is minimized/not visible;
- default: hide when WeChat is not the foreground app, to avoid floating over unrelated apps;
- track move/resize/monitor/DPI changes.

### Anchoring

Default remote-message placement:

```text
hud.left = remoteBubble.right + gap
hud.top  = remoteBubble.top
```

Use collision resolution if there is insufficient space.

The current WeChat layout has substantial empty space to the right of remote bubbles, which is the preferred HUD area.

### Collapsed view

Initially show at most 2–4 concise rows, for example:

```text
询问/确认       88%
期待回应         91%
依赖前文         79%
```

### Expanded view

May show:
- all judgment outputs;
- raw probabilities;
- OCR confidence;
- pipeline timing in debug mode.

No generated reply is required for V0.

## 15. Privacy and logging

Default:
- in-memory short conversation buffer;
- no persistent raw chat logs;
- no screenshot persistence;
- no API payload persistence.

Debug fixture export must be explicit and user-triggered.

Diagnostics should prefer:
- timing
- dimensions
- counts
- hashes
- redacted snippets

over full chat contents.

## 16. Error handling

The UI must degrade gracefully.

Examples:
- WeChat not found -> idle/status, no crash
- WeChat minimized -> suspend capture/HUD
- capture fails -> retry with bounded backoff
- no bubble detected -> do nothing, debug trace
- OCR low confidence -> mark/skip instead of fabricating
- Jev unavailable -> keep perception running; show semantic layer unavailable
- API key missing -> explicit local configuration status, no crash
- overlay cannot anchor -> hide that HUD rather than covering random UI

---

## 17. Performance instrumentation

Measure at minimum:

```text
capture_ms
change_detect_ms
bubble_detect_ms
ocr_ms
jev_ms
render_ms
total_ms
```

Also track:
- capture/check frequency
- CPU usage during idle
- duplicate-message suppressions
- OCR confidence
- heuristic detection score

Do not optimize solely from synthetic benchmarks.
